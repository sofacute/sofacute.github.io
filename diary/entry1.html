			<br>ive been taking second life screenshots since 2019. i take pictures of everything that happens in my virtual life, and so the archives have become over 8gb big</br>
			<br>for a lot of that time i would post some of the pictures from my diary onto its own twitter account, and it became my habit to post parts of my diary frequently</br>
			<br>even when i wasnt posting, i was always taking pictures for myself, but ive always had the goal of sharing the diary with others.. i consider the diary and all its archives as a whole to be an ongoing artproject</br>
			<br>my posting on my twitter account has slowed down more and more, as i become more upset and uncomfortable with my relationship to it as well as the fact its just not a very good way of presenting or archiving my diary.. i tried to post on tubmlr, but i found the same issues</br>
			<br>so im going to try to post my diary on this website from now on, and this is how ill share it to the world moving forward</br>
			<br>the photos on this website are still curated, theres a lot of pictures that i didnt choose to share for one reason or another</br>
